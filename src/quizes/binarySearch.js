//1. calculate the midpoint of the current array
//2. if the target is in the middle, stop
//3. Otherwise, if the target is less that what's in the middle, repeat, changing the endpoint to be 
     //to be just to left of the middle
 //4. Otherwise, if the target is greater than what's in the middle, repeat, changing the start point 
    //to be just to the right of the middle
    
    
 // TARGET START END MIDDLE
 
 //nN/B YOUR ARRRAY NEED TO BE SORTED BEFORE USING BINARY SEARCH


 //In breadth first - we visit the nodes by level
 //In depth first - we visit the children of the nodes
